# Calculator_app

A simple calculator for basic operations designed using Pythons GUI module, Tkinter.

#### main.py:

Buttons are created from numbers 0-9 and buttons for the common arithmetic operators. They are arranged on the screen using TKINTER's grid layout system. When a button is clicked, the value is seen in the input field of the calculator. It uses the eval() function to compute the arithmetic expression in the input field.
There is also a clear() function to delete all entries in the input field and a delete() function to delete the last character of an entry in the input field.
